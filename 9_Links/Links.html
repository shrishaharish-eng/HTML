    <h1>Squirrels</h1>

    <p>
        Squirrels are commonly thought of as tree-dwelling mammals, but the squirrel
        family extends far beyond that to include ground-dwelling rodents such as
        chipmunks and prairie dogs, and flying squirrels.
    </p>

    <p>Two of the most common and best-known squirrel species are the:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_squirrel" title="Sciurus vulgaris">Red squirrel</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_gray_squirrel" title="Sciurus carolinensis">Eastern gray squirrel</a></li>
    </ul>
