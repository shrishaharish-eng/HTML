    <!-- When we want to add emphasis in spoken language, we stress certain words, subtly altering the meaning of what we are saying.
     
    In HTML we use the <em> (emphasis) element to mark up such instances. As well as making the document more interesting to read, these are recognized by screen readers, which can be configured to speak them in a different tone of voice. 

    In browser, the emphasized words appear in Italics
    -->

    <p>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong>.</p>

    <p>I am counting on you. <strong>Do not</strong> be late!</p>

    <!-- Strong importance also has semantic value of stressing the words.
     In browser, the strong importance words appear in Bold  -->

     <!-- Note: Don't use these just for the sake of making the text appear in Italics and Bold since they have semantic value. -->
