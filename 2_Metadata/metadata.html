<!-- Setting the language is useful in 2 ways:
 1. Allows the webpage to appear correctly in language-specific results
 2. It is useful to people with visual impairments using screen readers (for example, the word "six" exists in both French and English, but is pronounced differently.) 
 
 Note: You can also set subsections of your document to be recognized as different languages. E.g see Japanese section in the body of this document-->

    <!-- Specifying an author is beneficial in many ways: it is useful to be able to understand who wrote the page, if you have any questions about the content and you would like to contact them. Some content management systems have facilities to automatically extract page author information and make it available for such purposes.

    Specifying a description that includes keywords relating to the content of your page is useful as it has the potential to make your page appear higher in relevant searches performed in search engines (such activities are termed Search Engine Optimization, or SEO.) -->
