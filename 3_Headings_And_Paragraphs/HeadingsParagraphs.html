    <h1>The Crushing Bore</h1>

    <p>Our protagonist could not so much as a whisper out of the shadowy figure…</p>

<!-- Best Practices:
1. Preferably, you should use a single <h1> per page—this is the top level heading, and all others sit below this in the hierarchy.

2. Make sure you use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy. Don't use <h3> elements to represent subheadings, followed by <h2> elements to represent sub-subheadings—that doesn't make sense and will lead to weird results.

3. Of the six heading levels available, you should aim to use no more than three per page, unless you feel it is necessary. Documents with many levels (for example, a deep heading hierarchy) become unwieldy and difficult to navigate. -->

<!-- Semantics: Using the correct elements, giving our content the correct meaning, function, or appearance.

Semantic value of elements will be used in multiple ways, for example by search engines and screen readers.

Example: <h1> is a semantic element, while <span> can be styled to look like a heading, it doesn't have semantic value.
